  <section class="intro">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As our company explores ways to build mobile applications more efficiently, we are considering hybrid and cross-platform frameworks. Three leading options we have investigated are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PhoneGap/Cordova</li>
      <li>Flutter</li>
      <li>React Native</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This report summarizes key points to help management decide which technology best fits our needs.</p>

    <h2>Framework Comparison</h2>
    <div class="comparison-grid">
      <div class="framework-card">
        <h3>PhoneGap / Cordova</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Primarily uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build cross-platform apps. Wraps web code in a native shell.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Performance can sometimes lag behind native, especially for complex animations or heavy computations.</li>
          <li><strong>Community & Ecosystem:</strong> Older technology with a large ecosystem of plugins. However, newer tools are gaining more momentum.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> Easy for web developers, as it leverages familiar web technologies.</li>
          <li><strong>Tooling & Documentation:</strong> Mature documentation and tools, but less active modern support compared to newer frameworks.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="framework-card">
        <h3>Flutter</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Uses Dart and its own rendering engine to provide near-native performance and custom UI components.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Excellent performance close to native, due to compiled code and a high-performance rendering engine.</li>
          <li><strong>Community & Ecosystem:</strong> Rapidly growing ecosystem supported by Google, with a vibrant community and continuous improvements.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> Requires learning Dart and Flutter’s widget-based architecture, but provides a cohesive development experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Tooling & Documentation:</strong> Strong official documentation and a robust set of development tools (e.g., hot reload).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="framework-card">
        <h3>React Native</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Uses JavaScript (and optionally TypeScript) and React’s component model to generate native widgets on each platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Generally good performance, though bridging JavaScript and native code may cause overhead in some scenarios.</li>
          <li><strong>Community & Ecosystem:</strong> Backed by Facebook (Meta) with a huge community, abundant libraries, and continuous updates.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> Familiar to React web developers; however, requires understanding mobile-specific nuances.</li>
          <li><strong>Tooling & Documentation:</strong> Good documentation, rich ecosystem, and third-party libraries, though varying quality in some areas.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

  <section class="decision-factors">
    <h2>Key Decision Factors</h2>
    <p>Considering the needs of our company:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Development Speed:</strong> If we want to leverage existing web expertise, PhoneGap/Cordova or React Native might be simpler. Flutter requires learning Dart, but provides a highly productive environment once familiar.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-Term Support:</strong> Flutter and React Native have strong and growing communities. PhoneGap/Cordova is mature but may see less innovation going forward.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance & UI Experience:</strong> Flutter often excels in performance and offers a cohesive UI system. React Native provides native elements but depends on a bridge. PhoneGap/Cordova might lag due to webview-based rendering.</li>
    </ul>
